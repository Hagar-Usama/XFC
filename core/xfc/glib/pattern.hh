/// A GPatternSpec C++ wrapper interface.
///
/// A PatternSpec is the 'compiled' form of a pattern. Its match() and match_simple()
/// methods match a string against a pattern containing '*' and '?' wildcards with
/// similar semantics as the standard glob() function: '*' matches an arbitrary,
/// possibly empty, string, '?' matches an arbitrary character.
///
/// Note that in contrast to glob(), the '/' character can be matched by the wildcards,
/// there are no '[...]' character ranges and '*' and '?' can not be escaped to include
/// them literally in a pattern.
///
/// When multiple strings must be matched against the same pattern, it is better to compile
/// the pattern to a G::PatternSpec and use match() instead of match_simple(). This
/// avoids the overhead of repeated pattern compilation.
