The XFC widget demonstration program.
=====================================
The <docs/xfc-demo> directory contains xfc-demo, an XFC version
of the GTK+ widget demonstration program gtk-demo which is written
in C and comes with the GTK+ source code. 

The xfc-demo program looks and behaves exactly like gtk-demo. It
is not meant to be a good example of C++ program design. Its only
purpose is to show you examples of the many widgets available in 
the GTK+ library and how to use them in your XFC applications.

The xfc-demo program is compiled by default but you can disable 
this by passing the "--disable-demos" option to configure.
