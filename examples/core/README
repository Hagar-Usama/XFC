Example Core Library Programs.
============================== 
The <examples/core> subdirectory contains several libXFCCore test programs
that show you how to use the G::IOChannel, G::MainLoop and G::SpawnAsync
classes. The <examples/core/threads> subdirectory contains several threaded
test programs including a threadpool example. Although simple, these 
programs show you some important thread basics.

The example programs are compiled by default but you can disable this by 
passing the "--disable-examples" option to configure.
