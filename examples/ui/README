Example User Interface Programs.
================================ 
The <examples/ui> directory contains several example programs that
show you how to use the newer GTK+ widgets, including action-based
menubars and toolbars, combo boxes, the entry completion widget and
the file chooser widget. The mergemenu program shows you how to merge
menu and toolbar items dynamically in your applications. 

The example programs are compiled by default but you can disable this by 
passing the "--disable-examples" option to configure.
