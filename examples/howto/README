Example HOWTO Programs.
=======================
The <examples/howto> directory contains all the example applications that
the XFC widget HOWTOs work through. The widget HOWTOs can be found in the
<docs/howto> subdirectory. If you compiled XFC from source code yourself,
each example will have a makefile. You can compile all the examples at 
once by running make in the <examples/howto> directory. If you installed
XFC from a binary RPM file, each widget HOWTO will show you how to write
a simple makefile for the relevent example. 

The example programs are compiled by default but you can disable this by
passing the "--disable-examples" option to configure.
