The XFC Documentation.
======================
The <docs> directory contains all the reference and tutorial
documentation. The easiest way to access this documentation is
through the main HTML page, <docs/index.html>.

The <docs/faq> subdirectory contains a FAQ file that answers some 
frequently asked questions about GTK+ and XFC. 

The <docs/howto> subdirectory contains a collection of useful HOWTOs,
covering everthing from the basic structure and function of the XFC
libraries to widget programming. There is a HOWTO for most widgets. 
Each HOWTO first covers any important widget basics and then works
through a widget example. The source code for these examples can be
found in the <examples/howto> subdirectory. The HOWTOs are also
linked to the API reference so that their information is easily 
accessible from there.

The <docs/reference> subdirectory contains a complete API reference
manual. If you are using the SVN version of XFC, the API reference
will be compiled by Doxygen by passing the --enable-docs option to
configure. 

The <docs/tutorial> subdirectory contains the XFC tutorial "GTK+
Programming in C++ with XFC", which covers the basics of GTK+ 
programming in C++ using the Xfce Foundation Classes. Whether you're
new to GTK+ or an experienced programmer, you should find this 
tutorial beneficial and easy to follow. The source code for the 
tutorial examples can be found in the <examples/tutorial> subdirectory.
