	  docs/tutorial/html/chapter07.html,

2005-04-29 00:49  jcfranks

	* libXFCcore/xfc/trackable.[cchh]: Added a fix for a GCC compiler error
	for versions prior to 3.4.0. libstdc++ with these versions makes a call
	to the class placement new operator when it should call of the global new 
	operator. For GCC versions prior to 3.4.0 a class placement new operator
	is defined that simply calls the global placement new operator. The GCC
	version required is now 3.3.2 or higher.

2005-04-28 00:19  jcfranks

	* libXFCcore, libXFCui: Fixed a design flaw in the implementation of the
	XFC signal handling chain that prevented the loading and usage of Glade
	widgets. There are too many files to list here but includes all object
	and widget source files (*.cc) that handle signals.

	* libXFCglade: Added a libglade binding for GladeXML.

	* tests/glade: Added four simple libXFCglade example programs. 

2005-04-14 00:25  jcfranks

	implementation of Gdk::Rectangle was changed.

	* libXFCui/xfc/gtk/widget.[cchh]: Added a new constructor to Gtk::Allocation
	that takes a reference to a GtkAllocation object.

2005-04-12 21:52  jcfranks

	* libXFCcore/xfc/glib/main.cc: Fixed G::MainContext constructor that takes
	a GMainContext pointer as one of its argument. A typo caused this argument
	being ignored.  

	* libXFCui/xfc/main.[cchh]: For convenience, added a Gtk::Window pointer
	argument to Xfc::Main::run() that defaults to null. If a pointer to the 
	main application window is passed to run(), it automatically connects the
	main window's "destroy" signal to Xfc::Main::quit() and shows the window
	on the screen. Otherwise the application will have to manage showing and
	destroying the main window itself.

	* libXFCui/xfc/gdk/color.hh, 
	  libXFCui/xfc/gdk/inline/color.inl:

	so that it returns a Gdk::PangoRenderer pointer.

	  demos/xfc-demo/iconview.cc, 
	  demos/xfc-demo/rotated_text.cc: Added GTK+ 2.6 clipboard, iconview and

	For convenience when using filenames, added an overloaded set_value() 
	function that takes a std::string. 

	* libXFCui/xfc/gtk/treemodel.[cchh]: For convenience when using filenames,
	added an overloaded get_value() function that takes a std::string. 

2005-03-23 15:40  jcfranks

	* configure.ac: Version 4.3.1
